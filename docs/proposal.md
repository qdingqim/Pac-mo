## Project Pac-Mo

## Summary of the Project
Project Pac-Mo is an AI agent that plays a modified version of the Pac-Man by Bandai Namco Games. The goal of this game is to get the highest score from each stage, while the agent has to avoid four monsters in the closed map that kills the player at once if contacted. The dots that gives a player a score in the original game would be replaced by "the sword" in Minecraft; The monsters in the Pac-Mo, unlike the original game, cannot be eaten by the player; its moving speed and the ability to chase the player are varied by "the Level" of the game.

## AI/ML Algorithms
We are planning to use reinforcement learning with neural function approximator for the solving agent, and Dijkstra's algorithm for the monsters in the game.

## Evaluation Plan
The metrics of the project is the score which is calculated by the dots
